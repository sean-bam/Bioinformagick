## How I made the Viral world map
1. Making the World background.
 - I downloaded a free vector of the world. I removed the text, then split the vector into two layers: one of the land, and one of just the ocean. 
 - To do that, I selected both objects --> Pathfinder --> Minus front. This gives me an ocean object. I copied that object--> undo --> new layer -- >paste in place. Now the ocean object is lined up with just the land figure, on different layers. Saved as `map.ai` 

2. Building the Viruses. 
 - First I took the Expasy virion images. I pasted them in illustrator one by one. I cropped the image. Then, I would image trace them. The trick is that sometimes I would do two traces: one with "techincal drawing", and one with "6 color". The technical drawing was good for getting the outlines of the capsids. I would copy the "technical" object --> undo --> 6 color trace --> expand --> then paste the technical object in place on top of the 6 color object. The reason I chose 6 color is so that I can assign colors using a color theme. If I have too many colors, it is hard to change them. The color theme I chose is `enchanting planet`.
 - I can’t remember how I made siphoviridae tails. I think the puppet warp tool will be easier to do this in the future
 - One of the important things I learned was to scale the *pattern* but not the *object*. To do this, there is an option in the ‘scale’ tool at the bottom where you can deselect ‘transform object’ but keep the pattern selected.
